# Data Engineering IDS 706 by Professor Noah Gift

## Why??

Everything Data Engineering!!

Mostly about my learnings from class IDS 706 @ Duke University! Hoping that this repository will be extremely useful if you're looking to take up this course or are simply interested in data engineering!

### Week 1 Assignment: Discussion


```
Create a life-long learning plan by answering the following questions: **
What skills are you going to learn this quarter, why and how?	
What skills are you going to learn by the end of this year, why and how?
What skills are you going to learn by the end of next year, why and how?
What skills are you going to learn by the end of five years, why and how?
The length of post: max 500 words 
 
```

-In this quarter, few of the things I want to focus on is-
1) Strengthening Data Structures & Algorithms Concepts 
2) Becoming Proficient in Python and 
3) Diving into the world of Data Engineering (including AWS, SQL, Bash) by using the available resources, exploring the internet and c
ollaborating with others! This will help me with my long-term goals.
-By the end of this year, I want to be confident with my Data Engineering skills (including programming, database systems, communication etc.) 
by working on projects and completing certifications. I also want to learn and build my Github profile and create a platform for other students 
to learn along with me (about different courses, concepts, projects etc.).
-I wish to strengthen the skills learnt in the last quarter of 2022 by working on real-world projects in 2023. I wish to develop Machine Learning
models with everything I learnt through the years especially to help the health-care industry (using health-care data). As a Masters in Engineering 
Management Student, by the end of next year, I also wish to develop my management & technical skills by interning at a company. 
(It would be great to gain experience and put everything learnt to use in an industry alongside others!) 
-The future can be very uncertain but Iâ€™m excited to see what it holds! I'm currently interested in Data Science / Data Engineering, it is something 
that excites me and I wish to continue pursuing it in the future. Learning is a continuous process and technology is constantly evolving. 
In five years, I want to be in a place where I am up to date (or at least trying to be!) with the technology around me.
